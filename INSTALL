bashmount-au should work on all supported distributions with lsblk. Tested on RHEL6 & RHEL7.


Installation - run install.sh
============

1. As root, copy "bashmount-au" to "/usr/bin" or any other location in $PATH:

        install -m700 bashmount-au /usr/bin/bashmount-au

2. Backup any existing configuration files.

3. As root, copy "bashmount-au.conf" to "/etc/bashmount-au.conf" for global
   configuration:

        install -m600 bashmount-au.conf /etc/bashmount-au.conf

4. As root, copy "mediawatch.sh" to /usr/bin/mediawatch.sh

	install -m600 mediawatch.sh /usr/bin/mediawatch.sh

5. As root, copy "bashmount-au.functions" to /usr/share/bashmount-au/bashmount-au.functions

	install -m600 bashmount-au.functions /usr/share/bashmount-au/bashmount-au.functions

6. Optionally, copy "bashmount-au.conf" to "$HOME/.config/bashmount-au/config"
   for per-user configuration:

        mkdir -p $HOME/.config/bashmount-au/
        install -m600 bashmount-au.conf $HOME/.config/bashmount-au/config

7. Optionally, copy "bashmount-au.1" to "/usr/share/man/man1":

        gzip -9 bashmount-au.1
        install -m644 bashmount-au.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/bashmount-au.1.gz

8. Make life a bit easier by setting an alias to the mount command in "$HOME/.bashrc" or /etc/bashrc:

        alias mount='bashmount-au'


Configuration
=============

1. Disable autofs and gnome-automount & auto_run according to your distributions directions.

2. Create a group for data transfer personnel and assign designated personnel to group (ie. dta). 

3. Configure /etc/sudoers or domain role and allow group to run bashmount-au with elevated privileges. (ie. %dta ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/bashmount-au)
  NOTE: Permissions and ownership for mount executable and k3b should only allow root or data transfer group.

4. Configure /etc/bashmount-au.conf for desired checks and logfile and create files if necessary. Default is all strict checks. See config file for explanation and variable settings including optional second authentication.

5. Verify or change existing mount command and k3b binary to restrict to root or data transfer group. Remove all mounting of external devices in /etc/fstab.

6. Install inotify-tools from EPEL repository.

7. You should also set audit.rules and/or aide.conf watches on bashmount-au, bashmount-au.conf, and mediawatch.sh files.
